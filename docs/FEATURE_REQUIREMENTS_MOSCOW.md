# Feature Requirements - MoSCoW Prioritization

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive feature breakdown using the MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) prioritization framework for the Voice Description API Testing Tool. Each feature is evaluated based on user value, technical complexity, and business impact.

## Prioritization Criteria

Features are evaluated on:
- **User Impact** (1-5): How much value does this provide to users?

## Conclusion

This MoSCoW prioritization provides a clear roadmap for feature development, ensuring we focus on delivering maximum value with available resources. The Must Have features establish a solid foundation, Should Have features enhance competitiveness, and Could Have features position us for future growth.

Key principles:
1. **User value first** - Every feature must solve a real user problem
2. **Technical feasibility** - Complex features deferred until infrastructure mature
3. **Business alignment** - Features support adoption and revenue goals
4. **Risk management** - High-risk features in Could Have category
5. **Iterative delivery** - Ship early, iterate based on feedback
